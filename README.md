# Facial-State-Detection-Using-Customized-YOLOv5
### In this project, we will use YOLOv5 model to detect if the person in the image and live stream is sleepy or wide awake. 
We will use the custom variant to train the model on our own labelled image data. After that, we will test the model on image and the Video Stream.

# Resources We will Use in this Project
Resources are given below.
1. Pytorch
2. YOLOv5
3. OpenCV
4. Python
5. Jupyter Notebook

### Here is my compelte tutorial on how to run this notebook and how to label the images for your database:
